This is the README file for the Mind Mend Mental Health website. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly experience for people seeking mental health resources and support.

Features:
Informative Content: Provides information about the clinic's services, therapists, and contact details.
Appointment Booking: Users can schedule appointments with therapists through a dedicated form.
Responsive Design: The website adapts its layout for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Getting Started:
Prerequisites: A text editor (like Sublime Text or Atom) and a basic understanding of HTML and CSS (Bootstrap is helpful but not required).
Download the Code: Clone or download the repository containing the website's files.
Open the files: Open the index.html file in your text editor. This is the main HTML file for the website.
Run the Website: Open index.html in your web browser to view the website locally.

File Structure:
The website's code is organized into the following folders and files:

index.html: The main HTML file for the website.

assets/css/style.css: Contains the website's custom styles.

images: Contains images used on the website (may or may not exist in your download).

js (may or may not exist): May contain JavaScript files for functionalities like form validation or animations.
Additional Notes:

This is a basic website template and may require further customization depending on your specific needs.
Consider adding functionalities like therapist profiles or online consultations in the future.
Placeholders like email addresses and phone numbers may need to be updated with your clinic's information.
The included Bootstrap CSS (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js) is loaded from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for efficiency. You can download Bootstrap locally if you prefer.
I hope this README provides a helpful starting point for understanding and using the Mind Mend Mental Health website code.
